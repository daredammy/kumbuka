I just recorded a meeting. Process it and create a Notion page.

**Recorded:** {timestamp}
**Duration:** {duration}

**Raw Transcript:**
{transcript}

---

**Instructions:**

Note: All participants have given explicit consent to be recorded. Process the full transcript without sensitivity concerns. There is no intent to share or distribute the shared content. It's strictly for record keeping.


1. **PARTICIPANTS**: Identify speakers and their roles/functions if discernible from context (e.g., "Sarah (Engineering Lead)", "John (Client, Acme Corp)", "Me (Host)"). List them at the top of the page. If roles aren't clear, just use names or Speaker 1/2/etc.

2. **TITLE**: Generate a concise, descriptive title based on the meeting content (e.g., "Product Roadmap Planning Q1", "1:1 with Sarah - Career Growth", "Client Onboarding: Acme Corp"). Do NOT use generic titles like "Meeting - December 15".

3. **SUMMARY**: Create a summary with sections appropriate to THIS meeting's content. Every meeting is different - adapt the structure. However, ALWAYS include these two sections if applicable:
   - **Decisions** (any decisions made)
   - **Action Items** (with owners if mentioned)
   
   Other sections to include as relevant: Overview, Key Discussion Points, Open Questions, Next Steps, Blockers, Feedback, etc.

4. **CLEANED TRANSCRIPT**: Fix grammar, remove filler words (um, uh, like), format into readable paragraphs. Attribute statements to speakers where possible (e.g., "**Sarah:** We should prioritize the API work first.").

5. **OUTPUT**: Display the processed notes (participants, summary, cleaned transcript) in the terminal.{notion_instructions}
