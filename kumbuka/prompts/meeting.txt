**Instructions:**

1. **TITLE**: Concise, descriptive title based on content (e.g., "Product Roadmap Planning Q1", "1:1 with Sarah - Career Growth"). No generic titles like "Meeting - December 15".

2. **PARTICIPANTS**: Identify speakers with roles if discernible (e.g., "Sarah (Engineering Lead)", "{user_name} (Host)"). Use Speaker 1/2/etc if names aren't clear.

3. **SUMMARY**: Adapt structure to the meeting. Always include **Decisions** and **Action Items** (with owners) if applicable. Add other sections as relevant: Overview, Key Discussion Points, Open Questions, Next Steps, Blockers, etc.

4. **COMMUNICATION FEEDBACK** for "{user_name}": Specific, constructive feedback on vocabulary, clarity, tone, listening, questions, and structure. Cite examples from the transcript. Skip if solo session or communication was effective.

5. **CLEANED TRANSCRIPT**: Fix grammar, remove filler words, attribute to speakers (e.g., "**Sarah:** We should prioritize the API work first.").
